Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost

Description:
Built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle dataset. Implemented extensive preprocessing to handle imbalanced data and tested multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.). Achieved over 99% accuracy and high recall (>90%) using Random Forest. Visualized data distributions, correlation heatmaps, and confusion matrices for interpretability.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

1. Data preprocessing and feature scaling.

2. Class imbalance handling (SMOTE, undersampling).

3. Model comparison and hyperparameter tuning.

4. Evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC).

5. Visualization and interpretability of fraud detection models.
