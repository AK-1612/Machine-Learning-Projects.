Project Title: Heart Disease Detection.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Description:

1. Built a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. 
2. Implemented preprocessing steps, including feature scaling and data stratification, to prepare the data for training. 
3. Tested multiple classifiers with a focus on Logistic Regression, which achieved over 85% accuracy and strong recall for 
identifying at-risk patients. 
4. Designed an interactive prediction system to input patient data and instantly determine heart disease risk. 
5. Visualized dataset correlations and model performance for interpretability.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

1. Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
2. Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
3. Model training and evaluation using Logistic Regression.
4. Implementation of accuracy and recall metrics.
5. Development of an interactive heart disease prediction system.
